    "Let's dig in and try to understand more about the network of Computational Social Scientists using more advanced features. If your network has more than one component, just work on the giant connected component (GCC) in the exercises below. For the exercises below, you shall use the network you built in [Week 4](https://github.com/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/main/lectures/Week4.ipynb).\n",

    "> * Create a new graph, with the same nodes and edges, but where the association between nodes and field is shuffled. Compute the measure above for this randomized graph.\n",
    "> * Repeat the point above 100 times (at least). Plot the distribution of the values obtained and compare it with the value you have found for the real graph. Is the chance to connect to a member of the same field significantly higher than it would be by chance?\n",

(__Hint__: See [this paper](https://nbviewer.org/github/suneman/socialgraphs2019/blob/master/lectures/Week5.ipynb), eq (2)). **Important**: here I do not want you to use the NetworkX implementation, but rather to implement your own version of the measure.    \n",

Note: the Karate club split partitioning is avilable as a [node attribute](https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.get_node_attributes.html), called _\"club\"_.\n",
    "> 5. We will now perform a small randomization experiment to assess if the modularity you just computed is statitically different from $0$. To do so, we will implement the _double edge swap_ algorithm. The _double edge swap_ algorithm is quite old... it was implemented in 1891 (!) by Danish mathematician Julius Petersen(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Petersen). Given a network G, this algorithm creates a new network, such that each node has exactly the same degree as in the original network, but different connections. Here is how the algorithm works.\n",
    ">       * __a.__ Create an identical copy of your original network.\n",
    ">       * __b.__ Consider two edges in your new network (u,v) and (x,y), such that u!=v and v!=x.\n",
    ">       * __c.__ If none of edges (u,y) and (x,v) exists already, add them to the network and remove edges (u,v) and (x,y).\n",
    ">       * Repeat steps __b.__ and __c.__ to achieve at least N swaps (I suggest N to be larger than the number of edges).\n",
    "> 6. Double check that your algorithm works well, by showing that the degree of nodes in the original network and the new 'randomized' version of the network are the same.\n",
    "> 7. Create $1000$ randomized version of the Karate Club network using the _double edge swap_ algorithm you wrote in step 5. For each of them, compute the modularity of the \"club\" split and store it in a list.\n",
    "> 8. Compute the average and standard deviation of the modularity for the random network.\n",
    "> 9. Plot the distribution of the \"random\" modularity. Plot the actual modularity of the club split as a vertical line (use [axvline](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.axvline.html)). \n",
    "> 10. Comment on the figure. Is the club split a good partitioning? Why do you think I asked you to perform a randomization experiment? What is the reason why we preserved the nodes degree?\n",
    "> 11.  Use [the Python Louvain-algorithm implementation](https://anaconda.org/auto/python-louvain) to find communities in this graph. Report the value of modularity found by the algorithm. Is it higher or lower than what you found above for the club split? What does this comparison reveal?\n",
    "> 12.  Compare the communities found by the Louvain algorithm with the club split partitioning by creating a matrix **_D_** with dimension (2 times _A_), where _A_ is the number of communities found by Louvain. We set entry _D_(_i_,_j_) to be the number of nodes that community _i_ has in common with group split _j_. The matrix **_D_** is what we call a [**confusion matrix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). Use the confusion matrix to explain how well the communities you've detected correspond to the club split partitioning."
