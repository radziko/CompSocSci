    "plain": "The third single off the Grammy-nominated The Foundation album, \u201cToes\u201d brought Zac Brown Band back to the #1 spot on Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs. With a Jimmy Buffett-like style, \u201cToes\u201d describes the relaxing beach vacation of a traveler until he runs out of money, upon which he returns home and further relaxes there.\n\nSongwriter Durrette had the idea for the song on vacation in the Florida Keys, calling Brown at 5:30 AM with the intro. The rest was written in various locations, with Mullins and Hopkins providing input as well.\n\nSimilar to the message of \u201cToes\u201d, Durrette describes a worry-free writing process:\n\nWe have lots of books and journals and things in our computers \u2013 pieces that were started and not quite finished. We try not to overthink a song\u2026we take little pieces from things we\u2019ve written in the past, and if they fit melodically and make sense, we put them in the song."

       "plain": "The third single off the Grammy-nominated The Foundation album, \u201cToes\u201d brought Zac Brown Band back to the #1 spot on Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs. With a Jimmy Buffett-like style, \u201cToes\u201d describes the relaxing beach vacation of a traveler until he runs out of money, upon which he returns home and further relaxes there.\n\nSongwriter Durrette had the idea for the song on vacation in the Florida Keys, calling Brown at 5:30 AM with the intro. The rest was written in various locations, with Mullins and Hopkins providing input as well.\n\nSimilar to the message of \u201cToes\u201d, Durrette describes a worry-free writing process:\n\nWe have lots of books and journals and things in our computers \u2013 pieces that were started and not quite finished. We try not to overthink a song\u2026we take little pieces from things we\u2019ve written in the past, and if they fit melodically and make sense, we put them in the song."

    "plain": "\u201cColder Weather\u201d is a song that Wyatt Durrette began writing, which turned into a collaboration with Zac Brown, Coy Bowles, and Levi Lowrey. The song was ZBB\u2019s seventh studio single, and the second single from You Get What You Give.\n\nDurrette wrote the chorus and the melody, Durrette and Brown wrote the first verse and the last (alternate) chorus, Lowrey wrote the rest of the verses, and Bowles wrote the bridge.\n\nThe song was written in the perspective of a truck driver who is separated from his loved one by distance and weather.\n\nIn an interview with The Boot, Durrette stated:\n\nThere was a girl I was seeing, who lived in Kansas City. We really liked each other, but geography and timing just wasn\u2019t working for us. She was getting pretty frustrated with the whole thing and wanted me to slow down, as far as traveling so much and all those things. [\u2026] I was going to see her. We were in Green Bay, Wisc., playing a show with Little Big Town, and it was pouring down snow. We were supposed to go to Kansas City the next day for some radio thing, but the radio people canceled. Instead, we just went on to wherever we were going next. I had to call her and tell her that I wasn\u2019t going to make it. She was not a happy camper. She let me have it. I hung up the phone, walked on the bus and wrote the chorus and the melody to the chorus. [\u2026] As for me, it\u2019s a story of impossible love, where geography or timing gets in the way of it, and it\u2019s just not possible.\n\n\u201cColder Weather\u201d peaked at #1 on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Hot Country Songs, #29 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, and #47 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song also reached Double Platinum certification in the U.S. selling 2,017,000 copies, and Gold certification in Canada selling 40,000 copies."
