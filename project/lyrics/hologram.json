One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell and you can see the bars and touch 'em. The other one is sittin' in a prison cell but you can't see the bar\u2014you think you're free.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the human race is suffering from is mass hypnosis. We are being hypnotized by people like this: newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in a country and in a world that is being run by unbelievably sick people. The chasm between what we're told is going on, and what is really going on, is absolutely enormous.\u201d\n\n[Chorus: Block McCloud]\nIt's like we all know what's goin' down\nBut no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?\nThese motherfuckers, they controllin' us now\nWhen no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves\nAnd everybody's just walkin' around\nHead in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave\nBy then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up\nWelcome to the end of days\n[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]\nEverybody a slave, only some are aware\nThat the government releasin' poison in the air\nThat's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair\nI ain't never caught slippin', never underprepared, yeah\nThey Shaitan army, they display it proudly\nGeorge Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley\nThey want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi\nThe enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me\nThere's fluoride in the water, but nobody know that\nIt's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac (For real?)\nHow could any government bestow that\nUpon people who believe in political throwback?\nThat's not all that I'm here to present you\nI know about the Black Pope in Solomon's Temple (Yeah)\nAbout the Vatican assassins and how they will get you\nAnd how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube\n\n[Chorus: Block McCloud]\nIt's like we all know what's goin' down\nBut no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?\nThese motherfuckers, they controllin' us now\nWhen no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves\nAnd everybody's just walkin' around\nHead in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave\nBy then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up\nWelcome to the end of days\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]\nWhoever built the pyramids had knowledge of electrical power\nAnd you know that that's the information that they suppress and devour\nWho you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?\nWho you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?\nThe same ones that invaded Jerome\nThe ones that never told you about the skeletons on the Moon, yeah\nThe ones that poison all the food you consume\nThe ones that never told you 'bout the Mount Vesuvius tombs (Brrat)\nThe bird flu is a lie, the swine flu is a lie\nWhy would that even come as a surprise?\nYeah, the polio vaccine made you die\nIt caused cancer and it cost a lot of people they lives\nDo y'all know about Bohemian Grove?\nHow the world leaders sacrificin' children in robes?\nLucifer is God in the public school system\nI suggest you open up your ears and you listen\n\n[Chorus: Block McCloud]\nIt's like we all know what's goin' down\nBut no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?\nThese motherfuckers, they controllin' us now\nWhen no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves\nAnd everybody's just walkin' around\nHead in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave\nBy then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up\nWelcome to the end of days\n[Outro: David Icke]\n\u201cThe greatest hypnotist on the planet Earth is a oblong box in the corner of the room. It is constantly telling us what to believe is real.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can persuade people that what they see with their eyes is what there is to see, you've got them. Because they'll laugh in the face of an explanation that portrays the bigger picture of what's happening\u2026and they have.\u201d31Embed"

   "lyrics": "73 ContributorsYou Can\u2019t Be Neutral on a Moving Train Lyrics[Intro: Howard Zinn]\nGovernments lie all the time. Well, not just the American government, it's just in the nature of governments. Well, they have to lie. And since they don't represent the people, and so since they act against the interest of the people, the only way they can hold power is if they lie to the people...\n\n[Ophelia of the Spirits]\nYou don't know what I know\nYou can't see the spreading stain of deception\nI am cruel to myself\nThings will never be the same\n[Howard Zinn]\nIf they told people the truth, they wouldn't last very long.\n[Ophelia of the Spirits]\nI will hold my silence\nLike a weapon in my hand\nIf I used it I would murder myself\nYou could never understand\n\n[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]\nColumbus came ashore, greeted with nothin' but niceness\nSailin' west in attempt to find gold and spices\nDominated by the popes in frenzy for ices\nThe Catholic church expelled Jews and claimed it was righteous\nThe first man to see land would get a reward\nAnd get a yearly pension for life, clearly from God\nA young sailor saw land, said, \"We isn't far!\"\nColumbus lied, said he saw it the evening before\nThey touched ground, they were greeted by the Arawak\nColumbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat\nHe wanted to find their source of gold and that was that\nAnd when they thought that wasn't fair then he stabbed their back\nWhen there was no more gold, he took slaves instead\nAnd left a quarter million Indians in Haiti dead\nThe men died in mines, the women died at work\nThe children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt\nThey were just takin' advantage of a passive people\nThey were just bein' the savages of massive evil\nThat's the church work, that's the path of massive ego\nThat's the blood of Abraham bein' stabbed by the steeple\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]\nIn 1619 they were patiently waitin'\nFor a ship that carried slaves that was changin' the nation\nThe white man was a cannibal, prayin' to Satan\nHatred, contempt, a pity of patronization\nThat's the cornerstone of everything racism based in\nThe African had a more advanced civilization\nBlack was slave, master was white, rationalization\nFifty million dead, that's Western civilization\nAt first they appeared in the north\nAnd they were helpless in the face of superior force\nAnd all of them were chained together, they really was lost\nRacism isn't natural, it's merely divorce\nBefore the slave trade, black was considered distasteful\nBy the Oxford dictionary, I find it disgraceful\nIt's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful\nIt's the natural enemy of the critical staple\nSlavery grew as the plantation system grew\nThe reason for that's kinda easily traceable\nSociety of helpless dependence was capable\nOf saying, \"Fuck a slave master! You're in slavery too!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]\nSeven slaves were put to death for murderin' Master\nFear of slave revolt had them developin' faster\nYou a Cataline killer, ineloquent bastard\nI would burn the white man while smellin' the ashes\nFrom time to time, white man was part of the resistance\nWhite indentured servants wanted no part of the system\nKing Philip's War showed that if people would listen\nThen they can maybe break the complex chain of oppression\nTyranny is tyranny, but that's a concession\nBut the women, they was treated like that of possessions\nBlack women had it worse 'cause they was abused\nThat's the white justification, the Aryan blues\nThe next move was to dominate the Mexicans\nJames Polk dominated them like they was next of kin\nHe sent Colonel Cross to lie to them and let them in\nEleven days later his skull was crushed, so message sent\n\"We take nothing by conquest,\" that was the mantra\nThe military wasn't human, they was just monsters\nHenry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes\nDenounced the Mexican War and got locked in shackles\n[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]\nThe twentieth century opened, anger re-emerged\nReality of ordinary life was bein' heard\nAnarchists and feminists came from factory work\nCommunism, socialism, seemed to be re-birthed\n\u201cWar is the health of the state\u201d is what Bourne said\nAnd if you was born around that time, you was born dead\nThe Espionage Act had people confused\n'Cause it was double talk, and they ain\u2019t know how it\u2019d be used\nSupposedly it was an act against spyin'\nDubois knew that that was bullshit and they was lyin'\nCharles Schenck was arrested in Philadelphia\nFor printin' and distributin' leaflets 'cause they was helpin' ya\nHe was indicted, tried and then found guilty\nAnd spent six months in jail, don\u2019t that sound silly?\nHad his freedom taken away by his own nation\nBut there\u2019s a lesson, do not submit to intimidation\nThe act still exists today and this shit is real\nSupposedly, Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed\nEugene Debs did ten years for no purpose\nHe obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service\n\n[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]\nThe post office started takin' mail privileges\nOf magazines who printed anti-war sentiments\nA Socialist named Fairchild had it right\nHe said that, \u201cThey can shoot me, but they can\u2019t make me fight!\"\nThey sentenced him to a year in jail and that was reckless\nSixty-five thousand men, conscientious objectors\nThey were sent to army bases to work there\nThey were treated sadistically and were hurt there\nThey were strangled with the hemp rope till they collapsed\nAnd officers punched they stomach and they lower back\nA garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle\nAbout six inches from them so they couldn\u2019t swallow\nThe war ended in nineteen hundred and eighteen\nThe government was just tryin' to wipe the slate clean\nHemingway wrote 'Farewell to Arms'\nDalton Trumbo wrote 'Johnny Got His Gun'\nThe war was over, but they didn\u2019t learn they lesson\nTwin tactics of control, reform and repression\nThe patriotic fervor of war had been invoked\nThat\u2019s why the country that you live in is a fuckin' joke!\n\n[Outro: Vinnie Paz]\nYou cannot be neutral on a moving train\nThis is a story about the lies that your teacher told you\nThis is real, actual, factual\nNo lies in the whole record\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, look it up!\nI\u2019m tryin' to share the shit that I learned with y'all\nDo the knowledge!\nYour government does not care about you\nThe people in power do not care about you\nUnderstand that! Power to the people!\n\n[Howard Zinn]\nWar is like a fix. You know, you get high on war \u2014 \u201cWe won! We won!\" \u2014 and then you look down on the ground again and you need another fix, you need another war. Why do you think we\u2019ve had war after war after war after war? Every war, they say: \u201cThis is the end. This is the last war.\u201d In World War I, they said: \u201cThis is the war to end all wars.\u201d And then, not long after that, was World War II. And then soon the United States was waging war in Korea, and then Vietnam. If you study history, what you learn is that wars are always accompanied by lies. Wars are always accompanied by deception.15Embed"
