  "plain": "Born Erin Michelle W\u00fcthrich, singer-songwriter Ryn Weaver took the world by surprise when her first single \u201cOctahate\u201d hit Soundcloud, receiving endless praise and quickly rising to the No. 1 spot on Billboard\u2019s Emerging Artists Chart.\n\nRyn studied the arts at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California, and then moved to New York to dance and pursue a possible acting career through NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She attained several roles for short films and mini-musicals, but ended up dropping out. Before returning to California, Weaver met producer Benny Blanco and they developed a tight friendship. He took her under his wing and signed her to his label Friends Keep Secrets, which is under Interscope Records.\n\nWith the help of Blanco, British singer Charli XCX, and Passion Pit\u2019s Michael Angelakos among others, \u201cOctahate\u201d caught the attention of celebrities like Jessie Ware and Paramore\u2019s Hayley Williams. Racking up nearly 4 million plays on Soundcloud alone and 8 million on Spotify, Billboard called the song a \u201cviral sensation.\u201d The song was followed by her debut EP, Promises.\n\nHer debut album, The Fool, was available for streaming through iTunes Radio a week before its scheduled release of June 16th, 2015. It received mixed reviews from critics across the board\u2014she was compared to Stevie Nicks for her instrumentation and aesthetic but scrutinized because she \u201ccan\u2019t seem to figure out who she is.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NY Magazine, Ryn talked about her songwriting and the album\u2019s message:\n\nI\u2019m a performer and I definitely love a larger-than-life story and performance. I think if you\u2019re writing things that are truthful and beautiful and helping other people deal with their demons, then there\u2019s room for you. [\u2026] The record poses the question: Is it foolish to settle for what you always thought you wanted as a 22-year-old woman, or is it foolish to go and leave what\u2019s so beautiful, stable, and certain? I think that\u2019s a question a lot of young women have these days, especially coming from a generation of girls who\u2014in my opinion\u2014have less of a road map. It\u2019s not just about being a woman: It\u2019s about being a modern human and about fear of commitment."

    "plain": "The debut single by Ryn Weaver, co-written by Charli XCX. It\u2019s a stop-go whimsy track where she reflects on how her former lover mistreated her and left her emotions disarrayed. Originally found on her first EP Promises, \u201cOctaHate\u201d featured on her debut studio album, The Fool.\n\nRyn refers to her inspiration for this track as the pivotal point in her career thus far:\n\nI was still so in love with this person and they really betrayed me. [\u2026] Funny thing is, through that relationship, not only did I meet Benny Blanco, who\u2019s my producer now, I met my best friend. That situation, that toxic romantic thing kind of brought me a lot of beautiful, wonderful things and pushed me to move to L.A. in the first place, start fresh, and really focus on my music.\n\nIn early 2015, she released the first music video, but filmed a second video on May 13th that fitted the Renaissance visuals of her album (watch it above by pressing play!).\n\nDuring a livestream on Periscope, Ryn gave an in-depth explanation on the new video\u2019s symbolism \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just a food fight with a best friend. In the video, Ryn encounters the girl that her ex-boyfriend was being unfaithful with. They\u2019re meeting for the first time, having a meal, and although they have common grounds for an altercation, they hug it out afterwards."

    "plain": "According to an Instagram post following the release of the song, Reasons Not To Die is an apology to Ryn Weaver\u2019s friends for being an \u201cass hat\u201d on her birthday. Weaver wrote the song with Max Hershenow of MS MR, \u201cthe first person [she] felt comfortable [writing] with\u201d during a time when she was afraid of releasing music. She was reluctant to even release this song, as she thought no one would care or want to hear a song so somber and raw, but her label convinced her to let them feature it on their 10 year compilation album. The song is her first solo release since her debut album, The Fool."

Weaver wrote the song with Max Hershenow of MS MR, \u201cthe first person [she] felt comfortable [writing] with\u201d during a time when she was afraid of releasing music. She was reluctant to even release this song, as she thought no one would care or want to hear a song so somber and raw, but her label convinced her to let them feature it on their 10 year compilation album. The song is her first solo release since her debut album, The Fool."
