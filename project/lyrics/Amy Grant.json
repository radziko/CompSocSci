  "plain": "By the time Amy Grant was nineteen, she was Contemporary Christian music\u2019s most celebrated singer. Grant grew up in the Church of Christ where she sang for God two nights a week. As a teen, she decided to pursue a career in music, writing her first song while attending devotional meetings at her high school.\n\nGrant recorded a demo while working as an intern at a recording studio and the owner was so impressed he signed her to his own label and released her first album Amy Grant in 1977. It spawned three top 10\u2019s on Billboard\u2019s Christian Songs chart.\n\nThe following year, Grant began touring while balancing college studies. Her second album My Father\u2019s Eyes was released in April 1979. At its record release party, she met future first husband gospel singer Gary Chapman. He\u2019d written its title track, and it would become her first of many Christian Songs Chart-toppers. Her third album Never Alone came out in 1981 and features the #3 Christian Songs hit \u201cLook What Has Happened To Me\u201d.\n\nAfter two live albums, her 1982 album Age To Age officially made Grant a Christian Contemporary Music superstar, becoming the first CCM album ever certified Gold (1983) and Platinum (1985). It was later named Gospel Album Of The Decade in a poll done by Billboard Magazine. After a 1983 holiday album, Grant released Straight Ahead \u2013 her first to generate enough initial sales to chart on the Billboard 200.\n\n1985\u2019s Unguarded brought Grant into the mainstream with her top 30 pop crossover \u201cFind A Way\u201d, followed by \u201cWise Up\u201d which peaked at #66. Her first trip to the top of the Hot 100 would happen the following year with \u201cThe Next Time I Fall\u201d, a duet with Peter Cetera. That same year, Grant and Chapman married. Her 1988 album Lead Me On was a step back in terms of pop crossover success, but still offered four singles that topped the Christian Songs Chart.\n\nGrant\u2019s Grammy-nominated 1991 album Heart In Motion exploded into the mainstream when its lead single \u201cBaby Baby\u201d topped the Hot 100, then \u201cEvery Heartbeat\u201d reached #2. The album also spawned three more top 20s that year, making her a national pop superstar \u2013 a move that bothered some devout Christian fans who called the album \u201ctoo secular\u201d. Many Christian radio stations and retailers spoke out against the album for \u201ccrossing over\u201d and stopped airing its songs. As of 2018, Heart In Motion is her only album to chart outside of the US. It has been certified 5x platinum and remains the best-selling Christian Music album of all time.\n\nIn late 1993, Grant did a Christmas special with and performed in three concerts with Vince Gill. In 1994, she invited him to record the duet \u201cHouse of Love\u201d. Her album of the same name followed that year and its lead single \u201cLucky One\u201d and the title track became Grant\u2019s final top 40 pop crossover hits.\n\nMeanwhile, Grant\u2019s relationship with the married Gill grew to the point she would note on a legal pad each time she was around him. By the end of the year, Grant reportedly told her husband, \u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore. You\u2019re the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made\u2026 I\u2019ve given my heart to another man.\u201d Rumors flew over the next few years about infidelity (which they have both denied).\n\nGrant released Behind The Eyes in 1997. That same year, Gill announced he was getting a divorce. She learned of it from a newspaper headline, to which her husband commented he \u2018was grateful someone had finally made the first move\u2019. Grant soon divorced Chapman and married Gill in 2000, explaining to The Tennessean that while her relationship with Gill \u2018may have hastened the end of her marriage\u2019, she believes \u2018the final result was inevitable\u2019. Chapman, however, disagreed, noting \u201ca lot of people just don\u2019t want to believe the obvious\u201d.\n\nMany devout Christian fans were shocked by the divorce, commenting, \u201cAmy did not have one valid biblical reason to divorce her husband,\u201d and \u201cGod hates divorce. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d Early on, even Grant\u2019s children often made comments to Gill like \u201cYou make me sick. Put a shirt on.\u201d and \u201cIf you ever hurt my mother, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d However, the couple feel the birth of their child Corinna in 2001 helped the family eventually bond.\n\nSince 2002, Grant\u2019s albums have marked a return to more overtly Christian themes. The first of these albums, Legacy\u2026 Hymns And Faith, is her last to be certified Gold, but several of the singles from these albums have still shown up in the top 40 of the Christian Songs Chart over the last two decades."

    "plain": "\u201cBaby Baby\u201d topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991 and became Amy Grant\u2019s first number-one hit song as a solo artist.\n\nAmy had a tough time writing \u201cBaby Baby\u201d because her first attempts to write a romantic-sounding lyric to the song came off as sounding like \u201csome overgrown football jock with no vocabulary trying desperately to be romantic.\u201d\n\nOne day, after Amy saw her then-newborn daughter Millie, she said to herself, \u201cOh, baby, baby\u201d and the song was written in her kitchen in 10 minutes.\n\nAccording to the liner notes on the Heart in Motion album, \u201cBaby Baby\u201d is dedicated to Millie, whose \u201c6-week-old face was my inspiration.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Grant released a 25th Anniversary edition of her biggest single, remixed and featuring Tori Kelly.\n\nThe re-release \u201cwasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d Amy told Genius.\n\nMy manager started talking to my label about what to do to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the song. \u00a0My manager suggested a new\u00a0version of the song, and the label came back with the suggestion of Tori, which, of course, we loved the minute it was suggested!
