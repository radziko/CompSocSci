Williams, at 6 foot 1 inch, is a combo guard.\n\n\n\nAfter a stint in the then-NBA Development League, Lou put up averges of 11.3 points, 3.2 assists and 2 rebounds per game during the 2007-08 season. He signed a five-year, $25 million contract to stay in Philly shortly after.\n\nWilliams signed with the Atlanta Hawks in 2012 and played there for two years.

In 2019, he became the NBA\u2019s career leader in points scored off of the bench. This earned him his third Sixth Man trophy, joining Jamal Crawford as the only three-time winners of the award.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a passionate hip-hop fan, Lou has recorded several rap tracks and was featured on Philadelphia native Meek Mill\u2019s I Want It All. He plans to release his debut EP in 2020."
