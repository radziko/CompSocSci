  "plain": "Cody Jinks is an American country music singer-songwriter  from Denton, Texas.  Born in Haltom City, Texas, he started into music by learning to play country guitar from his father.  As a teenager, he moved to heavy metal, forming a band called Unchecked Aggression.\n\nThat band broke up after a few years and Jinks took a year off from music. In 2005 he started playing again, but this time he came back to country.  \u201cI grew up with country music, with some rock \u2019n\u2019 roll mixed in, and I came back to it,\u201d Jinks said.\n\nJinks' dry baritone will remind some of Waylon Jennings, and while clearly country, his songs have more personal experience in them. \u201cThe first record I did was very Nashville,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d\n\nJinks got messed up in a bad management deal in 2010 so he\u2019s taken to running his own career. Today he records and performs as Cody Jinks and the Tone Deaf Hippies. Lead guitarist Jon Wallace, bass player Joshua Thompson and drummer Brendon O\u2019Neil fill-out the band."

Right after I had a chance to sit down Cody Jinks before his concert at The District I asked where the song \"Loud and Heavy\u201d came from. He told me an interesting story. \u201cI had that hook in my head, from my son and I, we\u2019re riding down the road and at the time I was still touring in a white van, this was a few years ago, it was his second birthday\u2026and he wanted to go to the tractor supply company and see tractors, so of course I took him. While we were up there it started to rain real heavy and started to thunder. I said \"hey buddy, there\u2019s a loud thunder and heavy rain out there\u201d and he said \u201cloud thunder, heavy rain\u201d over and over\u2026so well I had to cut him in on that song.\u201c -JD Collins"
