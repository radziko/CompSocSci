  "plain": "Ritt Momney (originally called the spooks) is the indie solo project of Salt Lake City native Jack Rutter.\n\nUnder the name the spooks, Ritt Momney released their first single, Cold, which gained popularity in the hallways of Highland High School in Salt Lake City, Utah in the spring of 2016. The original members were Jack Rutter, his now ex-girlfriend Lindsey Lloyd, and friends Auden Winchester, Hank Thompson, Zach Olson, and Chris Kearl.\n\nBeginning as an indie rock band comprised of high school friends, the project became a personal outlet for Rutter after his bandmates left on Latter-Day Saint missions and his girlfriend left for college. In his bedroom, he began writing, recording, and producing his upcoming debut LP, entitled \u201cHer and All of My Friends,\u201d in which Rutter grapples with loss, loneliness, and his drift away from Utah Latter-Day Saint culture. Nowadays, the band\u2019s members often come and go, leaving Jack Rutter at the center of it all. Besides Rutter, there is no \u2018official\u2019 set of band members.\n\nA live Ritt show features Rutter, Jonas Torgersen, Noah Hamula, and Sam Olson."

    "plain": "On Ritt Momney\u2019s instagram, Jack explains the song:\n\n\u201cIn the song, a 14-year-old version of me has a pretty extensive conversation with God and the Devil. This conversation is meant to represent what was going on in my head from age 14 to around age 18 \u2013 from my first real doubts about religion, to decidedly not believing in it at all, to realizing that I have no idea what\u2019s out there. When I first stopped believing in my church and religion in general, I immediately began looking for everything wrong with it. I felt superior to the people who believed, like I had solved the puzzle and they were all still confused. But when I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents I was atheist and we started talking about it, I began realizing how much hope and happiness religion had brought them and others. I realized how hypocritical I was being, and that it shouldn\u2019t be about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong; it should just be about what works. And what works for you won\u2019t necessarily work for everyone else.\n\nAll I\u2019m trying to say with this song is that spirituality should be a personal endeavor. If you know for yourself that you have \u201cthe truth,\u201d that doesn\u2019t give you the right to know it for anyone else. People shouldn\u2019t have to deal with judgement or pity or passive-aggressive comments for \u201cfalling away\u201d from their church. And I\u2019m sure that God or whatever other higher power may be out there would agree with me on that.\""

       "plain": "On Ritt Momney\u2019s instagram, Jack explains the song:\n\n\u201cIn the song, a 14-year-old version of me has a pretty extensive conversation with God and the Devil. This conversation is meant to represent what was going on in my head from age 14 to around age 18 \u2013 from my first real doubts about religion, to decidedly not believing in it at all, to realizing that I have no idea what\u2019s out there. When I first stopped believing in my church and religion in general, I immediately began looking for everything wrong with it. I felt superior to the people who believed, like I had solved the puzzle and they were all still confused. But when I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents I was atheist and we started talking about it, I began realizing how much hope and happiness religion had brought them and others. I realized how hypocritical I was being, and that it shouldn\u2019t be about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong; it should just be about what works. And what works for you won\u2019t necessarily work for everyone else.\n\nAll I\u2019m trying to say with this song is that spirituality should be a personal endeavor. If you know for yourself that you have \u201cthe truth,\u201d that doesn\u2019t give you the right to know it for anyone else. People shouldn\u2019t have to deal with judgement or pity or passive-aggressive comments for \u201cfalling away\u201d from their church. And I\u2019m sure that God or whatever other higher power may be out there would agree with me on that.\""

    "plain": "\u201cPut Your Records On\u201d is Ritt Momney\u2019s first release following his July 2019 album, Her and All of My Friends. The track is  a cover of Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s 2006 hit, \u201cPut Your Records On,\u201d taken from her debut, self-titled album.\n\nThe song gained traction after becoming associated with a viral TikTok trend and even ranked at #6 on the Rolling Stones\u2018 Trending 25 chart in September. During a follow-up interview with Rolling Stone, Momney described the moment he realized his cover was taking flight:\n\nThe song was doing pretty well, but it wasn\u2019t doing nearly as well as it was before the TikTok trend began. It started to get playlisting, and I was super stoked about that. And then, it really was an almost overnight shift. It happened fast, and within a day or two, I was getting on all these Zoom calls with labels. It was intense. It seemed like I was just chilling and then, all of a sudden, a hundred people run into my house like, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!'"

The track is  a cover of Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s 2006 hit, \u201cPut Your Records On,\u201d taken from her debut, self-titled album.\n\nThe song gained traction after becoming associated with a viral TikTok trend and even ranked at #6 on the Rolling Stones\u2018 Trending 25 chart in September. During a follow-up interview with Rolling Stone, Momney described the moment he realized his cover was taking flight:\n\nThe song was doing pretty well, but it wasn\u2019t doing nearly as well as it was before the TikTok trend began. It started to get playlisting, and I was super stoked about that. And then, it really was an almost overnight shift. It happened fast, and within a day or two, I was getting on all these Zoom calls with labels. It was intense. It seemed like I was just chilling and then, all of a sudden, a hundred people run into my house like, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!'"
