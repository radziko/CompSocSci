   "description": {
    "plain": "Though it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song and played often in churches, \u201cHallelujah\u201d lyrically has a very different story, namely the second verse. While it uses a large amount of religious references and imagery, it can speak more towards a relationship that is not necessarily with God.\n\n\u201cHallelujah\u201d is Hebrew, meaning \u201cGlory to the Lord.\u201d However, the word could be a synonym for a variety of things, such as love, life, or specific experiences. The line \u201cIt\u2019s a cold and it\u2019s a broken Hallelujah\u201d proposes that there are different types of Hallelujah, not just one that is taxing on a person and one-sided, or \u201ccold and broken.\u201d\n\nLeonard Cohen, the original writer of the song, gave some insight into his lyrics:\n\nAll the perfect and broken Hallelujahs have an equal value. It\u2019s a desire to affirm my faith in life, not in some formal religious way but with enthusiasm, with emotion.\n\nPentatonix released this cover as the lead single off of their second Christmas album, A Pentatonix Christmas."

       "plain": "Though it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song and played often in churches, \u201cHallelujah\u201d lyrically has a very different story, namely the second verse. While it uses a large amount of religious references and imagery, it can speak more towards a relationship that is not necessarily with God.\n\n\u201cHallelujah\u201d is Hebrew, meaning \u201cGlory to the Lord.\u201d However, the word could be a synonym for a variety of things, such as love, life, or specific experiences. The line \u201cIt\u2019s a cold and it\u2019s a broken Hallelujah\u201d proposes that there are different types of Hallelujah, not just one that is taxing on a person and one-sided, or \u201ccold and broken.\u201d\n\nLeonard Cohen, the original writer of the song, gave some insight into his lyrics:\n\nAll the perfect and broken Hallelujahs have an equal value. It\u2019s a desire to affirm my faith in life, not in some formal religious way but with enthusiasm, with emotion.\n\nPentatonix released this cover as the lead single off of their second Christmas album, A Pentatonix Christmas."

    "plain": "is a Christmas song addressing Mary, mother of Jesus, with lyrics written by Mark Lowry in 1984, and music written by Buddy Greene in 1991. It was originally recorded by Christian recording artist Michael English on his self-titled debut solo album in 1991. At the time, English and Lowry were members of the Gaither Vocal Band, and Greene was touring with them.[1] The song reached Number 6 on CCM Magazine\u2019s Adult Contemporary Chart.[2] Lowry would record the song several times himself, most notably with the Gaither Vocal Band on their 1998 Christmas album, Still the Greatest Story Ever Told.\n\nThe song has since gone on to become a modern Christmas classic, recorded by hundreds of artists over the years, across multiple genres.[1] Different versions have reached the top ten in the Billboard R&B and Holiday charts.\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c was originally released in the key of E\u266d minor, with a tempo of 53 beats per minute based around a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013D\u266d\u2013A\u266dm7\u2013B\u266d7sus4\u2013B\u266d7 and is in the 4\n4 meter.[3] The lyrics evolved from a series of questions that Lowry scripted for a Christmas program at his church:\n\nI just tried to put into words the unfathomable. I started thinking of the questions I would have for her if I were to sit down & have coffee with Mary. You know, \u201cWhat was it like raising God?\u201d \u201cWhat did you know?\u201d \u201cWhat didn\u2019t you know?\u201d[1]\n\nNone of the questions are answered in the song. Instead, the lyrics poetically invite the listener to contemplate the relationship between Mary and her newborn divine son,[4] even if her faith and awareness did not yet include the details of what would unfold.[5]\n\nThe text has received criticism for perceived ambiguity or lack of scriptural or theological depth.[4][6] For example, Lutheran writer Holly Scheer, in addressing the rhetorical question of the song\u2019s title, wrote: \u201cAnyone who has even a slight familiarity with the biblical account of Christ\u2019s conception and birth shouldn\u2019t need to ask if Mary knew, because the Bible plainly tells us she did.\n\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c is the eleventh track on Cee Lo\u2019s Christmas album Cee Lo\u2019s Magic Moment. On December 15, 2012, the song appeared on the US R&B Songs chart at number 22, and peaked three weeks later at number 9. This version is the slowest of all. It also served as the closing credits song to the 2014 20th Century Fox movie Son of God.\n\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c is the sixth track on Pentatonix\u2019s second Christmas album, That\u2019s Christmas to Me.[13] The song both debuted and peaked at No. 26 on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending December 6, 2014."

       "plain": "is a Christmas song addressing Mary, mother of Jesus, with lyrics written by Mark Lowry in 1984, and music written by Buddy Greene in 1991. It was originally recorded by Christian recording artist Michael English on his self-titled debut solo album in 1991. At the time, English and Lowry were members of the Gaither Vocal Band, and Greene was touring with them.[1] The song reached Number 6 on CCM Magazine\u2019s Adult Contemporary Chart.[2] Lowry would record the song several times himself, most notably with the Gaither Vocal Band on their 1998 Christmas album, Still the Greatest Story Ever Told.\n\nThe song has since gone on to become a modern Christmas classic, recorded by hundreds of artists over the years, across multiple genres.[1] Different versions have reached the top ten in the Billboard R&B and Holiday charts.\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c was originally released in the key of E\u266d minor, with a tempo of 53 beats per minute based around a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013D\u266d\u2013A\u266dm7\u2013B\u266d7sus4\u2013B\u266d7 and is in the 4\n4 meter.[3] The lyrics evolved from a series of questions that Lowry scripted for a Christmas program at his church:\n\nI just tried to put into words the unfathomable. I started thinking of the questions I would have for her if I were to sit down & have coffee with Mary. You know, \u201cWhat was it like raising God?\u201d \u201cWhat did you know?\u201d \u201cWhat didn\u2019t you know?\u201d[1]\n\nNone of the questions are answered in the song. Instead, the lyrics poetically invite the listener to contemplate the relationship between Mary and her newborn divine son,[4] even if her faith and awareness did not yet include the details of what would unfold.[5]\n\nThe text has received criticism for perceived ambiguity or lack of scriptural or theological depth.[4][6] For example, Lutheran writer Holly Scheer, in addressing the rhetorical question of the song\u2019s title, wrote: \u201cAnyone who has even a slight familiarity with the biblical account of Christ\u2019s conception and birth shouldn\u2019t need to ask if Mary knew, because the Bible plainly tells us she did.\n\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c is the eleventh track on Cee Lo\u2019s Christmas album Cee Lo\u2019s Magic Moment. On December 15, 2012, the song appeared on the US R&B Songs chart at number 22, and peaked three weeks later at number 9. This version is the slowest of all. It also served as the closing credits song to the 2014 20th Century Fox movie Son of God.\n\nMary, Did You Know?\u201c is the sixth track on Pentatonix\u2019s second Christmas album, That\u2019s Christmas to Me.[13] The song both debuted and peaked at No. 26 on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending December 6, 2014."
