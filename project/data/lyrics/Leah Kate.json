  "plain": "Leah Kalmenson (born September 9, 1992), famously known as Leah Kate, is an American electro-pop and pop-punk singer-songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWith a passion for music at a very early age, complemented with a very musical family owner of a radio and the dream to be a pop-star at the age of five, Kate already knew what she was going to with her life. She started taking voice lessons, which eventually led to the musician to post covers on her YouTube channel.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, knowing that her family \u201chad the mentality that you should get a job and do music on the side\u201d, Leah decided to start contacting producers through the emails she founded online, and got some responses, though nothing life-changing. So, with no other option but to do it herself, she moved to New York and, with a remote job, her music career was about to start.\n\n\u201cI See You\u201d, her debut single, was released on May 25, 2018, a track that \u201cdidn\u2019t come from the happiest place, but I turned it into something people could have a good time to\u201d in words of the artist herself. The song was then followed by a few singles, like \u201cWTF?\u201d, released on March 22, 2019, or \u201cSo Good\u201d, two months later, which both eventually would be included on Kate\u2019s debut extended-play, Impulse, on mid-year.\n\nAs Leah came back to L.A. before the pandemic, all the effort from the past few years started to paying off as her back then first hit started to blow-up on TikTok. \u201cFuck Up the Friendship, with now over seventy million stream only on Spotify, has settled as one of the artist\u2019s most popular songs from her career. It was released on June 11, 2020, as the second single of her sophomore EP, Used To This.\n\nOn 2021, after dropping her songs \u201cCalabasas\u201d, \u201cVeronica\u201d and \u201cShit Show\u201d, the singer released what would be her last independent project to date, What Just Happened? on October 1.\n\nWith end of the WJH era, \u201cDear Denny\u201d started to gained popularity and became the main reason why Kate was signed with 10k Projects.\n\n\u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d was released on March 23, 2022, as her first song under the new label. It became her biggest hit to date going viral all over social media, especially on TikTok, and expanding her music to a whole new public that didn\u2019t know about the American artist. The single was later included on her most recent and successful project, Alive And Unwell, along with \u201cMonster\u201d, \u201cHot All The Time\u201d and \u201cLife Sux\u201d.\n\nKate has named No Doubt, Gwen Stefani, Avril Lavigne, blink-182 and Green Day as the biggest influences on her music."

    "plain": "\u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d is Leah Kate\u2019s  first charting single. Kate wrote the song with Madi Yanofsky (Co-writer on Nessa Barrett\u2019s \u201cI Hope Ur Miserable Until Ur Dead,\u201d and Jessie Murph\u2019s \u201cLook Who\u2019s Cryin Now\u201d) and Canadian producer Mike Wise, who also helped Kate pen the What Just Happened? track \u201cF U Anthem.\u201d\n\nLyrically, the song resembles the 2008 Miley Cyrus hit \u201c7 Things,\u201d listing reasons to hate a former lover. However, in both songs, the last item on the list is that the singer hates that they fell for the lover in the first place; making them fall in love.\n\nHere, Leah Kate has caught her boyfriend cheating. Though she\u2019s angry, she still has feelings for him, so she makes a list to remind herself of everything she hates about him."

Kate wrote the song with Madi Yanofsky (Co-writer on Nessa Barrett\u2019s \u201cI Hope Ur Miserable Until Ur Dead,\u201d and Jessie Murph\u2019s \u201cLook Who\u2019s Cryin Now\u201d) and Canadian producer Mike Wise, who also helped Kate pen the What Just Happened? track \u201cF U Anthem.\u201d\n\nLyrically, the song resembles the 2008 Miley Cyrus hit \u201c7 Things,\u201d listing reasons to hate a former lover. However, in both songs, the last item on the list is that the singer hates that they fell for the lover in the first place; making them fall in love.\n\nHere, Leah Kate has caught her boyfriend cheating. Though she\u2019s angry, she still has feelings for him, so she makes a list to remind herself of everything she hates about him."
