Originally being released on April 19, 2020, the song didn\u2019t gain much traction until October of 2020, after it went viral on TikTok.\n\ncarolesdaughter made a video talking about the sudden viralness of the song. In the video, she said:\n\nI didnt realize this song was gonna blow up i just found a youtube beat i liked and recorded on my phone i cant put it on spotify bc copyright but itll stay on soundcloud dont worry thank u 2 everyone for the kind messages \ud83d\udc97\n\nAs said in her video, she wasn\u2019t able to release the song officially onto all platforms due to complications with the beat, which was produced by HVLX. Then, through the help of Arista Records and Sony Music Entertainment, \u201cViolent\u201d was finally released officially onto all platforms on November 23, 2020, her 18th birthday."

Originally being released on April 19, 2020, the song didn\u2019t gain much traction until October of 2020, after it went viral on TikTok.\n\ncarolesdaughter made a video talking about the sudden viralness of the song. In the video, she said:\n\nI didnt realize this song was gonna blow up i just found a youtube beat i liked and recorded on my phone i cant put it on spotify bc copyright but itll stay on soundcloud dont worry thank u 2 everyone for the kind messages \ud83d\udc97\n\nAs said in her video, she wasn\u2019t able to release the song officially onto all platforms due to complications with the beat, which was produced by HVLX. Then, through the help of Arista Records and Sony Music Entertainment, \u201cViolent\u201d was finally released officially onto all platforms on November 23, 2020, her 18th birthday."
