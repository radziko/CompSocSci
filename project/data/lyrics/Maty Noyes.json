  "plain": "Maty Noyes is a singer-songwriter from Mississippi signed to Lava/Republic Records.\n\nNoyes was signed to Lava Records by CEO Jason Flom in late 2014, when she was just seventeen. Flom \u201cbelieve[d] strongly that she will be a star\u201d and signed her to his label, noting that her sound was mature beyond her years, much like superstar labelmate Lorde.\n\nOriginal material that had been previously released independently was wiped from the internet, allowing her to make her major-label debut in August 2015 as a featured artist on The Weeknd\u2019s Beauty Behind The Madness closer \u201cAngel\u201d. Following the track\u2019s release, she released her first solo single, \u201cCharge It To The Game,\u201d. She also appeared on Kygo\u2019s single \u201cStay\u201d, which became her first charting release.\n\n\u201cIn My Mind\u201d was released as the lead single from her debut EP, Noyes Complaint, and is her most successful solo release to date with over 100 million Spotify streams. The full EP was released in October 2016 featuring four additional tracks. \u201cLondon\u201d and \u201cSay It To My Face\u201d were released as standalone singles in 2017. Noyes released a series of singles in summer 2018 leading up to her second EP, Love Songs From a Lolita, released on August 10. It featured the title track, \u201cLava Lamps\u201d (featuring Beekwilder) and \u201cPorn Star\u201d.\n\nNoyes left Lava Records shortly after the EP\u2019s release, signing to MITS Records in 2019. The singles \u201cLove Don\u2019t Cost a Thang\u201d and \u201cSunlight\u201d precede her long-awaited debut album, due for release later this year."

    "plain": "\u201cNew Friends\u201d is the 4th track on Maty Noyes' second extended play, Love Songs From a Lolita. It was released as an EP track on August 10th, 2018.\n\nThe song was first teased on Noyes' Instagram, where she posted an animated teaser for the song, stating:\n\nNew friends : a song about a lot of close friends letting me down, when I wrote this song I was in the thick of it. It\u2019s throwing major shade but it serves friendship realness.\n\nA music video for the song was first teased at the beginning of 2019 on her Instagram (as well as on her Twitter).\n\nA few weeks later, a music video teaser was posted on her Instagram (and Twitter) along with the release date of the video, which was later pushed back. The video shows Noyes taking cupcakes from the oven, and icing them with a special liquid, perceivably poison. She places them in the fridge with a written sign stating to not eat them.\n\nThe music video was eventually released on February 19th, 2019 on Noyes' channel. The video was written and directed by Ian Rowe."

It was released as an EP track on August 10th, 2018.\n\nThe song was first teased on Noyes' Instagram, where she posted an animated teaser for the song, stating:\n\nNew friends : a song about a lot of close friends letting me down, when I wrote this song I was in the thick of it. It\u2019s throwing major shade but it serves friendship realness.\n\nA music video for the song was first teased at the beginning of 2019 on her Instagram (as well as on her Twitter).\n\nA few weeks later, a music video teaser was posted on her Instagram (and Twitter) along with the release date of the video, which was later pushed back. The video shows Noyes taking cupcakes from the oven, and icing them with a special liquid, perceivably poison. She places them in the fridge with a written sign stating to not eat them.\n\nThe music video was eventually released on February 19th, 2019 on Noyes' channel. The video was written and directed by Ian Rowe."
