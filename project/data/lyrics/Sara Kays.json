  "plain": "Sara Kays is a singer, songwriter from a suburb in central Indiana.\n\nShe didn\u2019t grow up in a musical family. By the age of thirteen, her mom bought her first guitar for her and she knew then that she wanted to make a career out of it. When she turned fourteen she started playing gigs and busked around her hometown in an attempt to gain experience and exposure.\n\nThroughout high school, Sara was able to really find who she was as a singer, songwriter, and performer. She decided to move to Atlanta, Georgia after graduating to check out the music scene.\n\nDuring this time, she played gigs and open mics, finished up her first year of college, and recorder/released her debut EP A House Too Big.\n\nAfter a year in Atlanta, Sara decided to move to Nashville, Tennessee which she fell in love with when traveling there to record her EP.\n\nSara is currently in school & writing/recording her next release!

    "plain": "Detailing the pain of heartbreak over the strumming  of a guitar, Sara Kays exploded with popularity following the release of \u201cRemember That Night?\u201d Sara recounts the emotions felt after a year-long relationship came to an end, taking the listener through the misery immediately after the couple broke up, the struggle of trying to move on from her ex in the following months, and having to go through all the heartache again after her ex reached out trying to reconnect.\n\nOriginally teased on TikTok on October 28, 2020, Sara quickly recorded and published the song after the TikTok went viral with fans begging for the song\u2019s release. The song has amassed over 90 million streams on Spotify alone, quickly becoming Sara\u2019s most popular song."

       "plain": "Detailing the pain of heartbreak over the strumming  of a guitar, Sara Kays exploded with popularity following the release of \u201cRemember That Night?\u201d Sara recounts the emotions felt after a year-long relationship came to an end, taking the listener through the misery immediately after the couple broke up, the struggle of trying to move on from her ex in the following months, and having to go through all the heartache again after her ex reached out trying to reconnect.\n\nOriginally teased on TikTok on October 28, 2020, Sara quickly recorded and published the song after the TikTok went viral with fans begging for the song\u2019s release. The song has amassed over 90 million streams on Spotify alone, quickly becoming Sara\u2019s most popular song."

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe day after you said, \"Goodbye\"\nAll I did was lay in bed and cry\nBut after one month, I started to move on\nAnd after two, I felt alright\nThen three months in, you were off my mind\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd month four and five, I was living my life\nI was better and didn't have to try\nNot to think of you, until you reached out and said\n\"Remember that night?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWe went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning\nI kissed you, it was pouring\nWe held each other tight\nBefore the night was over\nYou looked over your shoulder\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe day after you had reached out\nI was broken for the second time around\nI prayed on the third day that I would be okay\nThat I'd forget you were ever mine\nOh, I don't think you realize\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nHow long I had to fight to be living my life\nTo get better and never have to try\nNot to think of you, until you reached out and said\n\"Remember that night?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWe went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning\nI kissed you, it was pouring\nWe held each other tight\nBefore the night was over\nYou looked over your shoulder\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\n\n[Bridge]\nDo you remember?\nRemember?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning\nI kissed you, it was pouring\nWe held each other tight\nBefore the night was over\nYou looked over your shoulder\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\nOh, I was doing fine\nYou said, \"Remember that night? Remember that night?\"\n[Outro]\nDo you remember?\nRemember?8Embed"
