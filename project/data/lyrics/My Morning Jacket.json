  "plain": "Formed in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1998 as a four-piece, My Morning Jacket has bloomed into one of the biggest American bands of the past decade. After guitarist and lead singer Jim James produced The Tennessee Fire and At Dawn, alt-country albums for Darla Records awash in reverb, MMJ was inked to ATO Records, where it began to turn toward alternative rock.\n\nBy the time the band made its critically acclaimed fourth record, Z, the current lineup\u2014including Carl Broemel (guitar), Tom Blankenship (bass), Patrick Hallahan (percussion) and Bo Koster (keyboards) along with James\u2014was set. In 2008, the band saw greater appeal after a performance on Saturday Night Live and earned its first Grammy nomination for its fifth album, Evil Urges. In 2009, an MMJ-centric episode of the animated cartoon American Dad brought the group wider exposure.\n\nThe band\u2019s known for its incendiary live show, including four straight years at Bonnaroo and a nearly four-hour set at the festival in 2008."

    "plain": "Jim James recounts on VH1 Storytellers:\n\nAll I can say is he was a real brilliant soul. I met him in the fourth grade. We were the same age but I always felt like he was a little older than me-he knew a little bit more than me. And we always had big dreams. We played in our first band together and dreamed big dreams and would see shows like Storytellers on TV or Unplugged (another music program that airs on VH1) and you know, the things you see on TV as a kid and you\u2019re like \u2018Whoa man, maybe someday we can do that.\u2019 But he just-no matter how much you told him how special he was, he could never hear it. I\u2019m sure you all know someone like that, that you just can\u2019t get through to them. And I didn\u2019t want to tell this story and get all emotional but I knew there\u2019s no way to not get emotional about it but he, like so many people like that, choose to leave this world. And sometimes you can\u2019t hardly blame them because this world can be a really hard place. But every time we play this song, he is with us. And I\u2019ll never forget playing it the first time, he was there. And every time we play it, he\u2019s there. And at the end of the song I always take a trip backstage to say hi to him, because we dreamed so much together and he didn\u2019t get to live out his ability to chase his dream. So, I wanted him to get a chance to play Storytellers with us.\"\n\n\n\nAt the end of the song Jim explains:\n\nThat song also has a happy ending because the reason I wrote that song for my friend was that I had a dream, a really beautiful dream that he was in heaven. And I don\u2019t know what heaven is, but in the dream it was the stereotypical heaven. It was hilarious, there were clouds and sun rays shining through and it was all white and he was dressed in a white robe with wings and everything. It was completely hilarious and he was so happy. And in the dream, somehow myself and everybody I knew had died and we were coming into heaven and he was there to welcome us because he was there before us. And he just looked great, you know he was doing great and signed us all in and got us all registered for, (laughs) all the wonderful benefits you get when you go to heaven like they tell you on TV (laughs). But he was there, and he looked great, so that gives me so much hope because I really do believe in other lives and other worlds and I really do think that if you have a tough time on this \u2018go-around\u2019 there is somewhere else in the future-there\u2019s another dimension you\u2019re going to be in. You\u2019re going to get to try it again you know, and everything is going to be OK. And he is OK out there somewhere so, the story has a happy ending.\""

       "plain": "Jim James recounts on VH1 Storytellers:\n\nAll I can say is he was a real brilliant soul. I met him in the fourth grade. We were the same age but I always felt like he was a little older than me-he knew a little bit more than me. And we always had big dreams. We played in our first band together and dreamed big dreams and would see shows like Storytellers on TV or Unplugged (another music program that airs on VH1) and you know, the things you see on TV as a kid and you\u2019re like \u2018Whoa man, maybe someday we can do that.\u2019 But he just-no matter how much you told him how special he was, he could never hear it. I\u2019m sure you all know someone like that, that you just can\u2019t get through to them. And I didn\u2019t want to tell this story and get all emotional but I knew there\u2019s no way to not get emotional about it but he, like so many people like that, choose to leave this world. And sometimes you can\u2019t hardly blame them because this world can be a really hard place. But every time we play this song, he is with us. And I\u2019ll never forget playing it the first time, he was there. And every time we play it, he\u2019s there. And at the end of the song I always take a trip backstage to say hi to him, because we dreamed so much together and he didn\u2019t get to live out his ability to chase his dream. So, I wanted him to get a chance to play Storytellers with us.\"\n\n\n\nAt the end of the song Jim explains:\n\nThat song also has a happy ending because the reason I wrote that song for my friend was that I had a dream, a really beautiful dream that he was in heaven. And I don\u2019t know what heaven is, but in the dream it was the stereotypical heaven. It was hilarious, there were clouds and sun rays shining through and it was all white and he was dressed in a white robe with wings and everything. It was completely hilarious and he was so happy. And in the dream, somehow myself and everybody I knew had died and we were coming into heaven and he was there to welcome us because he was there before us. And he just looked great, you know he was doing great and signed us all in and got us all registered for, (laughs) all the wonderful benefits you get when you go to heaven like they tell you on TV (laughs). But he was there, and he looked great, so that gives me so much hope because I really do believe in other lives and other worlds and I really do think that if you have a tough time on this \u2018go-around\u2019 there is somewhere else in the future-there\u2019s another dimension you\u2019re going to be in. You\u2019re going to get to try it again you know, and everything is going to be OK. And he is OK out there somewhere so, the story has a happy ending.\""
