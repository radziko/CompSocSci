  "plain": "Kentrell DeSean Gaulden (born October 20, 1999), better known by his stage name YoungBoy Never Broke Again (aka NBA YoungBoy), is a Louisiana rapper.\n\nYoungBoy started writing and making music around the age of fourteen, eventually dropping his first mixtape Life Before Fame in April of 2015.\n\nYoungBoy started to gain recognition when he dropped his projects Mind Of A Menace 3, Before I Go, and 38 Baby, but gained the most recognition for his hit song \u201c38 Baby.\u201d\n\nShortly after the success of \u201c38 Baby\u201d Young Boy was arrested on November 28, 2016, and was charged with two counts of attempted second-degree murder in connection with a drive-by shooting which occurred November 7, 2016. YoungBoy ended up being sentenced to a ten-year suspended prison sentence after serving six months in prison.\n\nAfter YoungBoy was released from jail, he dropped \u201cUntouchable\u201d which is one of his biggest hits to date. Following the release of \u201cUntouchable,\u201d YoungBoy released AI YoungBoy on August 4, 2017.\n\nLater on, in 2017 YoungBoy ended the year by dropping Ain\u2019t Too Long and started 2018 by releasing his debut studio album, Until Death Call My Name.\n\nNowadays YoungBoy has come up with more famous tracks such as \u201cDrawing Symbols,\u201d \u201cLil Top,\u201d \u201cHouse Arrest Tingz\u201d and \u201cAround\u201d. These have appeared on albums as AI Youngboy II, Still Flexin', Still Steppin' and Top.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, the rapper was taken into custody by the FBI on an outstanding federal warrant for drug and weapon charges which date back to 2016. While locked up, YoungBoy\u2019s team released the rapper\u2019s third studio album, Sincerely, Kentrell, on September 24, 2021: it was originally set to be released in May of the same year. Nearly a month after, on October 22, YoungBoy was released from jail on a $500K bond and is currently placed on house arrest in Utah.\n\nEnding 2021, YoungBoy partnered with the fellow Louisiana native, Birdman to present the two artists' joint mixtape, From The Bayou which would peak at #19 on the Billboard 200.\n\nBeginning 2022 to a ferocious start, YoungBoy would begin to diss King Von on songs such as \u201cBring The Hook,\u201d and \u201cFish Scale.\u201d These songs would soon appear on YoungBoy\u2019s eighteenth mixtape, Colors which would later peak at #2 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLater in the year, just a month afterward, YoungBoy would find himself in a viral controversy with the Chicago native, Lil Durk as both of them exchanged brutal disses from Durk\u2019s \u201cAHHH HA,\u201d to YoungBoy\u2019s \u201cI Hate YoungBoy\u201d \u2014 both regarding the death of King Von.\n\nFollowing his hastily start to 2022, YoungBoy would partner up with DaBaby to present the duo\u2019s joint mixtape, BETTER THAN YOU in March. The mixtape would later peak at #10 on the Billboard 200, this would mark YoungBoy\u2019s ninth top ten.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, continuing his victorious run, YoungBoy would release The Last Slimeto Sampler, a sample album for his August release, The Last Slimeto. This album would mark YoungBoy\u2019s final album with Atlantic Records.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, YoungBoy was found not guilty of his federal guns charge. In a interview on Instagram, YoungBoy announced that he and his team were planning to go on tour.\n\nAs planned, on August 5, 2022, YoungBoy released The Last Slimeto which would mark his last album with Atlantic Records, completing the contract. The album would also peak at #1 on the Billboard 200 marking his fifth #1 album. The project would also break a tie with Taylor Swift as it scored a #1 album in each of the past four years.\n\nOn September 6, 2022, YoungBoy released Realer 2 as a surprise release, it is presented as a sequel to his December 2018, Realer. Just over a month following the release of Realer 2, YoungBoy released the Juvenile-influenced mixtape, 3800 Degrees which would peak at #12 on the Billboard 200. Two weeks prior to the release of 3800 Degrees, YoungBoy would release yet another mixtape hosted by DJ Drama as a  part of his Gangsta Grillz series titled Ma\u2019 I Got A Family.\n\nThrough Billboard, on October 24, 2022, it was announced that following YoungBoy\u2019s departure from Atlantic Records, beginning 2023, he would release music under a joint venture deal between his own Never Broke Again and Motown Records.\n\nOn January 6th, YoungBoy released his fifth studio album, I Rest My Case \u2014 his first with Motown Records. It was an experimental album that featured trap-rage beats; it would peak at #9 on the Billboard 200."

That ain't my bitch\"\nTired of the bayou, I wan' take it out to New York\nAnd live a high life like a nigga signed with Highbridge\nI flash out and take his head from off his body\nI never once showed you that side, but that's who I'm is\nHidin' out, I let that .30 spit on College\nIf I die right now, just check the stats and see how I did\nI'm a real street nigga, yeah\nI just pulled my 'Retta out and tried to stop a nigga (Where you goin'?)\nI just walked outside my house and almost shot a nigga (Fuck is you doin'?)\nFuck my ex, I hope my next can probably top her, nigga\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nTake me to a place I can't imagine (Oh)\nVictim of heartbreak and I'm so damaged (Oh)\nSteppin' in blood with these thugs and I can't panic\nYeah, we knocked him off, nigga, what? They gotta hand it\n\n[Verse 2]\nI just took the foreign, went on the block and took the top off\nTalkin' out his top, I go by Top, I get him knocked off\nSee them youngins hoppin' out that Benz, that's some dropouts\nThey was hatin', I knocked 'em out my lens, that ain't my fault\nI'm with Herm, I'm drinkin' on that Henn' like a pawpaw\nPure codeine, they drinkin' on that gin, I been goin' off\nGoin' off on, on all these hoes waitin' on me to fall\nI walked in court dirty as the fuck with pee up in my drawers (Woo)\nBitch, I'm drunker than a fuck, I need some Tylenol\nI go nuts, soon as you buck, I shoot at all of y'all (Bah, bah)\nI left therapy with K3 and I sped off\nTalkin' proper as the fuck with my head off\nTalkin' proper as the fuck with my head off\nBeen goin' crazy, but I can't let my son see it all\nAll this love got me damaged, I just want it gone\nIf you my friend, let's get it in, bitch, take your panties off58Embed"

In this song, YoungBoy describes how he wanted to quit rapping but kept going cause he knew that eventually, his fame would come and because he didn\u2019t want to let his mother and brother too. He also explains how he\u2019ll take his friends from the hood to success with him.\n\nWhen YoungBoy was featured on the Genius Verified series he mentioned that this was the last song he recorded going into Jail and the first song he recorded when he left jail:\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy about it is it was the last thing I recorded before going in and the first one I recorded coming out. I ain\u2019t finish it before I went in. It was the last one that I did. I came home and I finished it. It was the last and the first."
