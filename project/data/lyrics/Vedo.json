  "plain": "VEDO is an American singer-songwriter born in Michigan.\n\nAt 13 years old he moved to Atlanta with his dad because of bad behavior in his mom\u2019s house and in school.  Since he was doing bad at school his father made him an ultimatum saying that if he doesn\u2019t get good grades he\u2019ll quit music. He eventually changed his ways and graduated with honors.\n\nHis first single as an artist was Traffic Jam, posted in 2011. In the same year, he released a mixtape called Rnb Monsta Vol. 1 on bandcamp. In the same platform, he released the second volume of Rnb Monsta, a Christmas EP, Certified Banger, She got that Bass and In this Room  (These last three were released in 2012).\n\nIn 2013, he appeared on the fourth season of The Voice where he reached the TOP 12 being eliminated in this stage.\n\nTwo years after he realeased his first mixtape \u201c93\u201d where is his most famous song \u201c4 Walls\u201d feautiring Natasha Mosley.\n\n\u201cState of Mind\u201d and As I Am were the next records that fans got the chance to hear, both in 2016.\n\nBut his debut album, from a label that he created New WAV Music Group, only came out in 2017, called From Now On.\n\nIn the next year, 2018, he wrote \u201cFreaky Friday\u201d by Lil Dicky and Chris Brown with 7 other people.\n\nIn 2019 he released his second official album, VEDO.\n\nIn the year after he came out with For You.\n\nHe also has a series of videos on his channel remixing famous songs, both from the past and the present. One of them, Girls Need Love, blew up on TikTok.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euvbMPL6pMM"
